          <h2>Facts About Cats</h2>
          <p>
            Cats have a remarkable sense of hearing and can detect higher
            frequencies than humans or even dogs. While humans can hear
            frequencies up to 20,000 Hz, cats can hear sounds as high as 64,000
            Hz! This extraordinary hearing ability helps them hunt small prey,
            like rodents, that make high-pitched noises. Interestingly, cats
            also recognize their owners’ voices but might choose to ignore them
            because they are independent creatures. They respond better to
            high-pitched sounds or whistles, so if you’re trying to call your
            cat, you may want to adjust your tone!

            The cat is a small, carnivorous mammal and a domesticated descendant
            of wild felines. Also known as the domestic cat, it is believed to
            have descended from the African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica).
            Cats were first domesticated by humans around 9,000 years ago,
            primarily in the Near East, where they helped protect grain stores
            from rodents. Their independent nature and hunting skills made them
            valuable companions to early agricultural societies.
